  "about": "I spent my childhood in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina &#127754 where I discovered my passion for computers. \n\nUsing the shared family computer, I would research many topics about the computer I was using, things such as 'how does this mouse work?'. From there I obtained an ever growing curiosity in computers. I started taking courses in highschool geared towards computer science such as college level mathematics courses and even an computer communications course. \n\nIn college, I became very involved in the Computer Science community and did everything I could to further grow my skill-set and passion within Computer's and Technology.",
